      <h2>General Information</h2>
      <p class="right-align">I have always thought that mathematics could and should be accessible to anybody, and that anyone can have success if they put in the time and care. I started this tutoring business, in part, because I want to help make that vision a reality. Thank you too all my clients, who also have decided to take a chance on that vision, and if you are just browsing, I hope you consider taking part in it!</p>
      <p>-Best regards</p>
